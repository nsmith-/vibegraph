# 29 — v0.1 validation sprint plan (design–implement–review chains)

Planned 2026-08-02, from TODO's "Validation-sprint slate (restricted scope,
decided 2026-08-02)". Precedes the `v0.1` tag's follow-up work; the scope it
validates is the restricted one: arbitrary fixed-order SM processes, unpolarized
pp / fixed-energy partonic beams, no decay chains.

## 1. Goal and exit criteria

Harden the restricted scope so every boundary a card can reach is a hard error
and every standing discrepancy is resolved or owned. Exit criteria, each a
recorded measurement (never an inference from "the suite passed"):

- **E1** `pp_to_jj` `samples` cell **GATE**: the conjugate-rep `ICOLUP` defect
  fixed, its χ² clearing the `1e-4` floor on every seed, and a regenerated
  20k-event sample carrying **0** mis-slotted antiquark legs (was 4758/80 000).
- **E2** The channel-partition tolerances retired: `gu_to_epemu` /
  `gux_to_epemux` gate below `rel_tol` 0.02 and `pp_to_llj` below 0.015, at
  tolerances justified by the reference's own error, after the per-point
  `AMP2_c` scale-channel draw. The partition probe
  (`probe_channel_partition_moves_sigma`) reads within its own Monte-Carlo
  error under the new draw.
- **E3** Hard errors, each with a refusal test: nonzero `polbeam1/2`;
  decay-chain commas in a process line; `propagators.py` present in a UFO
  directory; every physics-relevant run-card field the audit (§C2) finds
  parsed-but-unread. README's boundary claims become true statements.
- **E4** `ee_to_mumua`'s +0.80% drift **owned**: the windowed `pt(a)`
  comparison decides whether the remaining ~1% is ours or MadGraph 3.7.1's
  channel-weight change, with the evidence in this note's close-out.
- **E5** Census strictly improves: the three `uncovered` cells the `kt-spine`
  runs earned are measured; no green cell regresses; `validate_kt_cluster`
  stops being silently vacuous on fetching checkouts.
- **E6** the 8 `nn23lo1`-blocked ⛔ cells move to measured via the §G re-bank
  at `lhaid = 247000`, with `refdata-5` **replacing** the four superseded runs
  (bundle size roughly flat, retired runs to the local retired area).
- **E7** *(sidecar, non-blocking)* the U(1) charge-flow phase hypothesis
  (chain F) has a recorded verdict against its pre-registered bar — and, if
  very promising, a written refactor backlog entry in TODO (the refactor
  itself is out of this sprint).

## 2. Session protocol: design → implement → review chains

New this sprint: each work item is a **chain of three separate subagent
sessions**, so the sprint manager's job reduces to supervising and
reprioritizing on unexpected outcomes — not carrying design context through
implementation, and not being the only reviewer of work it also specified.

1. **Design session** — agent type `claude`, model **Opus**, read-only intent
   (it writes exactly one thing: its design section, appended to this note in
   its worktree). Input: the chain's brief below plus named code/note
   pointers. Output: a design section with (a) the concrete change list,
   file by file; (b) the acceptance tests, named; (c) the gates to run and the
   cells expected to move; (d) risks and an explicit "what this provably
   cannot break" claim. The manager reads the design before dispatching
   implementation — this is the reprioritization point.
2. **Implementation session** — agent type `validation-dev` (Opus by default;
   Sonnet where marked light). Executes exactly the design, no scope
   invention; runs the gates the design names; commits to the chain branch
   with command+output evidence in its report.
3. **Review session** — agent type `claude`, model **Opus**, fresh context,
   pointed at the chain worktree. Verifies rather than trusts: reads the full
   diff, re-runs the cheap gates itself, checks each design acceptance
   criterion against recorded output, and hunts specifically for the error
   class the implementation's own tests cannot see (AGENTS.md: every oracle
   has a blind spot). Verdict: **merge / fix (named defects) / escalate**.
   A "fix" verdict loops the implementation session (same worktree, same
   agent continued via SendMessage where possible); a second fix loop
   escalates to the manager.

Manager-side mechanics (AGENTS.md "Sprint & Subagent Operations" is binding):
pre-create each chain worktree off `main` (`git worktree add -b
val4/<chain> <path> main`), verify HEAD after dispatch, COW-copy the MG
reference data in (`cp -Rc`), require `cd` + toplevel/branch verification as
the first action, carry the long-command discipline verbatim in every brief.
The manager merges chains into the sprint branch in the §5 order and runs the
full banked gate after each merge, not only at the end.

## 3. The chains

### Chain A — conjugate-rep colour-flow tags (the `p p > j j` samples blocker)

The defect (note 28 §C2.5, TODO standing discrepancy): `SubprocessRecord::
relabelled` (`lhef/build.rs`) reuses the representative's `ColorFlowTags` for
every group member, so members whose legs carry conjugate SU(3) reps get
`ICOLUP` slots that are provably wrong for their own reps — measured 4758/80 000
legs on `p p > j j`, all antiquarks, reaching no other gated row.

- **Design questions**: conjugate the tags on relabel vs derive per member
  (note 28 recorded both as viable — pick one with reasons); how to widen
  `color_flow_tags_oracle` past each `P*` directory's *first* subprocess so
  the repair is gated rather than asserted; which record-layer self-check
  makes the defect class impossible to reintroduce (derive-and-check from the
  leg's own rep per member, not per representative).
- **Acceptance**: E1; oracle widened to every subprocess in every banked `P*`
  directory; `pixi run validate` census shows only the intended flips; the
  extended-validation colour/LHEF gates pass.
- **Models**: design Opus, implement Opus, review Opus. The subtle sign/index
  territory of the `color-flow` sprint's slot-swap bug lives here — nobody
  light.

### Chain B — per-point `AMP2_c` scale-channel draw (+ the dynamical-llj samples cell)

The residual `kt-spine` K6 left (note 28 §K6.5/§K6.8/§C.3): the scale reads
the sampler's channel, so σ at a channel-dependent scale is only defined up to
the channel partition. Fix by drawing the scale's channel `∝ AMP2_c(p)` per
point — MadEvent's own `iconfig` rule — decoupling the scale from this crate's
α-adaptation.

- **Design questions**: where the extra per-point draw's randomness comes from
  (a dedicated ChaCha8 substream so integrate/generate reproducibility is
  preserved seed-for-seed); whether the draw lives in the integrand or the
  scale prescription; artifact consequences (does anything banked change
  meaning — if yes, format-version bump and refusal semantics); which
  tolerances tighten and to what, justified by the reference's own error;
  interaction with `generate` (the same scale rule must run in the event
  pass — a sample whose scales disagree with its integral is a new defect).
- **Rider**: the `pp_to_llj_dyn` `samples` cell (uncovered cell (b), note 28
  §K5b.6) — the dynamical-scale llj card gets its own artifact + generation
  pass + samples comparison, taken here because this chain already rebuilds
  that path.
- **Acceptance**: E2, the rider cell measured, seed sweeps ≥5 with the budget
  axis scanned (AGENTS.md sampler-gating rules), `p p > j j` unmoved (its
  tolerance is already the reference's own error — a 2→2 gives the clustering
  no merge to choose).
- **Models**: all Opus. Largest blast radius in the sprint; merged last.

### Chain C1 — three small hard errors *(light)*

Per the scope decision: nonzero `polbeam1`/`polbeam2` (today parsed as known
fields, read by nothing); decay-chain commas (today misparsed as
required-s-channel syntax, dying with a misleading unknown-particle error —
`diagrams/parse.rs::parse_process_body`); `propagators.py` in a UFO directory
(today unread — a model defining custom propagators silently gets default
propagators, `ufo/mod.rs` file lists).

- **Acceptance**: three refusal tests with messages naming the unsupported
  feature and the tracked backlog entry's subject (not the plan item —
  AGENTS.md comment rules apply to error text too: describe the boundary in
  its own terms); hermetic suite still complete on a bare clone.
- **Models**: design **Sonnet**, implement **Sonnet**, review Opus (cheap
  chain, but the review checks the error paths actually fire from the CLI,
  not only from unit tests).

### Chain C2 — run-card ignored-field audit + the μF ≥ 2 GeV veto

The general form of C1's disease: the parser accepts every known field (typo
protection rejects unknown keys) but nothing proves the known-and-unread ones
are physics-inert. Plus the one *behavioral* silent disagreement in scope:
`reweight.f:1185` vetoes points with μF < 2 GeV; `coupling::scales` only
reports the scale (note 22 §4).

- **Design questions**: the audit method (walk `runcard.rs`'s default table
  against actual consumers — LSP reference queries per field); the
  classification (consumed / ignored-benign / ignored-physics→hard-error) and
  where its table lives so it is *asserted*, not documentary — a test that
  fails when a new field is added without classification is the durable form;
  veto semantics matched to `reweight.f` (veto the point vs error the run —
  MG vetoes, so we veto) and which gated row proves it (none today reaches
  μF < 2 GeV, so the test is a constructed card, and the design must say why
  no banked reference exercises it).
- **Acceptance**: E3's audit half; the classification test in the hermetic
  suite; veto implemented with a constructed-card test; DY and every gated σ
  row unmoved.
- **Models**: design Opus, implement Opus (the audit is judgment-heavy),
  review Opus.

### Chain D — `ee_to_mumua`: own the 3.7.1 drift *(measurement, not code)*

The widest σ row (+2.79 pull, rel +0.80%) and the tightest samples cell
(min KS p 2.74e-4), both moved when references went 3.5.7 → 3.7.1. The photon
is soft/collinear-regulated by cuts — exactly the region MG's channel-weight
change reallocates. The chain produces a **measurement**, in the style of
note 27 §B1's Higgs-pole windows: a windowed comparison over `pt(a)` that
localizes the disagreement or refutes localization.

- **Design questions**: window boundaries (from the banked sample's own
  `pt(a)` distribution); which side's per-window σ carries which error; the
  decision rule stated *before* the measurement (what pattern would convict
  our sampler vs the reference's reweighting) — pre-registered, so the
  outcome cannot be argued into either box after the fact.
- **Acceptance**: E4 — the measurement recorded in this note with the verdict;
  if ours, a filed defect with the diagnosis attached (fix may be its own
  chain, reprioritized then); if the reference's, the row's tolerance stays
  and the note documents why that is not a loosened tolerance (the reference
  moved, not us).
- **Models**: design Opus, implement Opus (it is an investigation — the
  "implementation" is instrumented runs), review Opus.

### Chain E — ForcePositive + cheap hygiene bundle *(light implement)*

- **`ForcePositive`** (note 28 §K5a2): ~5 lines in the PDF extrapolation path
  plus re-reading the interpolation gates' `FORCE_POSITIVE_FLOOR` screen; the
  checked-data relationship test
  (`the_only_difference_from_madgraphs_own_value_is_the_positivity_clamp`)
  becomes an exact-agreement assertion (205/205 clamped probes matching MG).
- **`validate_kt_cluster` declared tier** (note 28 §Z): register the gate as
  an `oracle`-layer `[[standalone]]` row and delete the silent
  `println!`-and-return — in the oracle layer absent dumps are a hard fail;
  the banked layer stops pretending to run it. (The bundle-the-75-MB
  alternative is rejected here for size; revisit only if the oracle layer
  proves too rarely run.)
- **`release-debug` `#[should_panic]` tests**: gate
  `eval_m2_pruned_rejects_boosted_frame` (and any sibling) on
  `cfg(debug_assertions)` so `cargo test --profile release-debug` is clean.
- **Uncovered cells (a) and (c)** (note 28 §S6): `ud_to_epemud_qcd0`
  `samples` comparison written against its banked event file;
  `ud_to_epemud_qcd0` counts banked into `diagrams.json` (35 = 35, becomes a
  passing hermetic gate).
- **`validate_scales` widening** (note 28 §K5a): the four `pdlabel = lhapdf`
  runs join `banked_events_reproduce_aqcdup_from_the_computed_scale`, closing
  cluster-scale → μR → αs(μR) in one per-event comparison.
- **Acceptance**: E5; every touched cell's flip visible in the report diff;
  no tolerance moved anywhere.
- **Models**: design Opus (one design session covers the bundle), implement
  **Sonnet**, review Opus.

### Chain F — sidecar: diagram phase from U(1) charge flow *(research-only, linked to nothing)*

A standing pattern rather than a standing defect (user, 2026-08-02): the
amplitude's flow-related phase conventions have been the sprint-over-sprint
bug generator — the `color-flow` fermion-flow slot-swap, the VVVV −i (note
16), every rooting sign now lifted into `fermi_sign`, and the one *fitted*
constant `G = ±i` serving the per-diagram and per-flow oracles. Each was fixed
locally and pinned by a test, but nothing derives them from a single
principle. The hypothesis to investigate: **following the diagram's U(1)
charge flow — the fermion-number/charge arrows as a flow structure, the way
SU(3) is handled as color flow — determines the diagram's phase, holistically
replacing the accumulated per-case conventions** (much simpler than SU(3),
since U(1) has no basis to permute — but possibly the same *kind* of
bookkeeping).

- **Strictly research-only.** No production code, no refactor, no touching
  `fermi_sign` or the evaluators. The deliverable is evidence and a verdict.
- **Design questions** (pre-registered before any derivation): what, exactly,
  the claim predicts — for each convention currently pinned by a test
  (`fermi_sign`'s cases, the VVVV phase, the fitted `G = ±i`, per-flow JAMP
  phases), what value the charge-flow rule derives and which existing oracle
  dump can check it; what result counts as "very promising" (proposed bar:
  the rule reproduces *every* pinned convention with zero free parameters, or
  reduces the fitted constants to derived ones) versus "interesting but not
  actionable"; which known-hostile cases to test first (the slot-swap
  configuration, an alternative rooting from the 165-rooting sweep, a
  multi-flow process).
- **Method**: derive on paper against the banked per-diagram × per-helicity ×
  per-flow complex dumps — the finest oracles already exist, so the
  investigation needs no new instrumentation, only scratch evaluation scripts
  in the worktree (never merged).
- **Acceptance**: a findings section in this note with the verdict against
  the pre-registered bar. **If very promising**: a written refactor backlog
  entry in TODO's feature backlog — scope, migration path, which tests would
  become derivations — explicitly *not* attempted this sprint. If not: the
  negative result recorded with the same care (why the rule under-determines
  the phase, which convention escapes it).
- **Sidecar semantics**: dispatched whenever bandwidth allows, blocks
  nothing, nothing blocks it, and no other chain may take a dependency on its
  outcome. Merges at most a note section and a TODO entry.
- **Models**: design Opus, research Opus, review Opus (the review checks the
  derivations against the dumps itself, not the researcher's summary of
  them).

## 4. §G — the `nn23lo1` re-bank (decided: option (i), user 2026-08-02)

Four banked runs (`pp_to_bb`, `pp_to_bb_qcd2`, `pp_to_llj`,
`pp_to_ll_scalefact2`) carry MG's internal `nn23lo1` parameterisation; 8 ⛔
cells. **Decision: option (i)** — re-bank the four cards at `lhaid = 247000`.
(The alternatives from note 28 §Z — implementing the internal parameterisation
with no oracle in this tree, or carrying the ⛔ cells into v0.1 — are
declined.)

**The re-bank is a replacement, not an addition.** The bundle is already
~100 MB and does not get to grow by superseded runs: `refdata-5` is
`refdata-4` with the four `nn23lo1` runs **removed** and their `247000`
re-banks in their place, so the size stays roughly flat. The retired runs go
to the local retired area, following the `pp_to_llj_qcd2_qed2` precedent
(note 27 D4: `~/src/generators/vibegraph-refdata-retired/`) — kept off the
bundle, recoverable by hand. The manifest rows move with them: the four
processes' cards change (`pdlabel`/`lhaid`), so their references change
identity, and any test still naming the `nn23lo1` variants must fail loudly at
the pin flip rather than read stale data.

It runs as an **oracle-layer background task** (MG runs detached per the
long-command discipline) started at sprint open, since nothing else depends on
it; the `refdata-5` publish + pin flip is its own gate, and the 8 cells flip
only on recorded measurements against the new runs (E6).

## 5. Sequencing and merge order

Dispatch waves (chains are independent worktrees; the wave structure is about
review/merge bandwidth and conflict surface, not data dependencies):

- **Wave 1 (dispatch together)**: C1, E designs; A design; the §G re-bank
  starts in the background (decided — no gate on the user remains).
- **Wave 2**: C1, E implement+review while A implements; C2 and D designs.
- **Wave 3**: B design (reads A's merged state — both touch event records);
  C2, D implement+review.
- **Wave 4**: B implement+review; §G re-bank lands as `refdata-5` + pin flip
  (replacement semantics per §4).
- **F (sidecar)**: dispatched whenever review/merge bandwidth allows —
  earliest in wave 2 — on no wave's critical path; it merges at most a note
  section and a TODO entry, so it never contends for the manifest/report
  conflict hotspot.

Merge order into the sprint branch: **C1 → E → A → D → C2 → B**, full banked
gate after each merge. Rationale: smallest blast radius first; A before B
because B's rider regenerates llj samples that must carry A's fixed tags; B
last because it is the only chain that can move σ cells. The manifest and
report tables are the expected conflict hotspot — chains touch disjoint rows,
so conflicts are mechanical, but the manager resolves them (never a subagent).

## 6. Risks and reprioritization triggers

- **Chain A finds the representative's tags wrong too** (not only the
  conjugate reuse): the widened oracle looks at members no oracle has seen —
  a real-finding risk. If it fires, A's review escalates and the fix becomes
  the sprint's centerpiece; nothing else depends on A except B's rider.
- **Chain B moves a σ row it should not**: the draw changes the integrand's
  variance structure. The pre-registered claim is that *only* the
  channel-dependent-scale rows move; any other movement is a defect in the
  draw, not statistics (AGENTS.md: a failure migrating between seeds under
  budget is a bug).
- **Chain D convicts our sampler**: E4 then spawns a fix chain, and the
  sprint's budget question goes to the user rather than being absorbed
  silently.
- **The audit (C2) finds a physics-relevant field a gated run already sets**:
  that is a latent wrong result, not a future hard error — it escalates
  immediately, because a census cell may be resting on it.
- **Session protocol overhead**: three sessions per chain is new. If the
  light chains (C1, E) show the design step adding latency without content,
  the manager may collapse design+implement for *light* chains only — a
  protocol observation to record in the close-out either way.

## Close-out

(To be written at sprint close: per-chain outcomes, census before/after,
protocol observations on the design–implement–review structure.)
